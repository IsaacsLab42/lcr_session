# Wish List

Some random things I'm thinking about:

- [ ] Switch to Niquests for HTTP/2 support. Church doesn't yet use HTTP/3, but Niquests would allow seamless transition for if/when they do.
- [ ] Would an async interface be useful at all?
- [ ] Authenticate against the lcrffe subdomain (financial system) for financial and budget reports
- [ ] Figure out how to send email from LCR. Currently failing with an authentication error.
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Document more endpoint URL's
- [ ] More examples in documentation
- [ ] Figure out how to directly authenticate with the API rather than using what is effectivly a web authentication method
